# Dotchk Timeout Analysis Report

## Summary

After analyzing the timeout warnings in the dotchk output and examining the codebase, I've identified several patterns and potential issues causing DNS query timeouts.

## Key Findings

### 1. Current Timeout Configuration
- **Default timeout**: 1000ms (1 second) set in `CheckerBuilder::default()` (checker.rs:40)
- **TLD-specific timeout**: 2000ms for most TLDs, with a few exceptions:
  - `.cz`: 1000ms
  - `.online`: 1000ms
- **Actual timeout used**: The minimum of the default timeout and TLD-specific timeout (checker.rs:132)
  - This means most queries are limited to 1000ms despite TLDs having 2000ms configured

### 2. Problematic TLDs Observed
The following TLDs frequently experience timeouts:
- `.mh` (Marshall Islands)
- `.bs` (Bahamas) 
- `.ga` (Gabon)
- `.icu`
- `.al` (Albania)
- `.mil` (US Military)
- Many brand/corporate TLDs (e.g., `.bradesco`, `.blockbuster`, `.wolterskluwer`)

### 3. Root Causes Identified

#### a) DNS Server Resolution Issues
- `.mh` uses `ns.ntamar.net` which doesn't resolve (NXDOMAIN)
- This causes immediate timeout as the server hostname can't be resolved

#### b) Timeout Too Short
- 1000ms may be insufficient for:
  - Geographically distant servers
  - Servers with high latency
  - Heavily loaded servers
  - Servers behind strict firewalls

#### c) UDP Packet Loss
- The tool uses UDP for DNS queries which can experience packet loss
- No retry mechanism for failed queries within the timeout window

#### d) Batch Processing Delays
- Batch processing interval of 100Î¼s might cause slight delays
- Large batches (up to 256 queries) could overwhelm some servers

### 4. Patterns in Timeouts

1. **Geographic Distance**: Many timeout-prone TLDs are from distant or smaller countries
2. **Corporate/Brand TLDs**: Higher timeout rate, possibly due to stricter security policies
3. **Legacy Infrastructure**: Some older ccTLDs may have less robust DNS infrastructure

## Recommendations

### 1. Increase Default Timeout
```rust
// In checker.rs:40
timeout_ms: 3000, // Increase from 1000ms to 3000ms
```

### 2. Implement Retry Logic
Add retry attempts for failed queries before declaring a timeout:
```rust
// Retry up to 2 times with exponential backoff
for attempt in 0..3 {
    match query_with_timeout().await {
        Ok(result) => return Ok(result),
        Err(DnsError::Timeout) if attempt < 2 => {
            tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500 * (attempt + 1))).await;
            continue;
        }
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    }
}
```

### 3. Category-Based Timeouts
Implement different timeout strategies based on TLD categories:
```rust
match tld_category {
    "ccTLD" => 3000,      // Country code TLDs
    "brand" => 4000,      // Corporate/brand TLDs
    "legacy" => 5000,     // Older infrastructure
    _ => 2000,            // Default
}
```

### 4. DNS Server Health Checks
Pre-validate DNS servers during initialization:
- Check if hostnames resolve
- Verify servers are reachable
- Cache server availability status

### 5. Implement TCP Fallback
For servers that consistently timeout with UDP, implement TCP fallback:
```rust
// If UDP fails, try TCP
if udp_result.is_timeout() {
    return tcp_query(domain, server).await;
}
```

### 6. Add Configuration Options
Allow users to configure timeouts via CLI:
```bash
dotchk --timeout 5000 --retry 3 check example.com
```

### 7. Improve Error Messages
Provide more detailed timeout information:
- Distinguish between DNS resolution failures and query timeouts
- Show which specific server failed
- Suggest using --timeout flag for problematic TLDs

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create a test suite for known problematic TLDs
2. Monitor timeout rates across different network conditions
3. Benchmark optimal timeout values for different TLD categories
4. Test with various DNS resolver configurations

## Conclusion

The timeout issues are primarily caused by:
1. Too short default timeout (1000ms)
2. No retry mechanism
3. Some DNS servers with resolution issues
4. Geographic and infrastructure variations

Implementing the recommended changes should significantly reduce timeout rates while maintaining reasonable performance.
